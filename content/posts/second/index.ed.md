"What if our furnitures could replace our conventional peripheral devices to control electronics in the living space?" 

 Let's simulate this smart furniture experience in an immersive VR environment!

## The VR Stool

![](/images/superform/george-prototype.gif "Instead of the conventional VR controllers, the users use the VR stool to interact with the VR environment!")

This keycap shaped stool would function as the VR controller (aka the peripheral) for the users to interact with the VR environment.

The form of the VR stool draws inspriration from keycaps and the semiotics of this shape invites the users to try to interact with the stool. The keycap shape is created by stretching and tying a piece of lycra over the internals of the stool.

## Interaction + Demo

## VR Level Design + Unreal Blueprints

This melancholy VR room is modelled with blender 3D and lighted in unreal engine.
Functionalities and animations are achieved with unreal blueprints.
