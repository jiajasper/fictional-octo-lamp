"What if our furnitures could replace our conventional controllers to interact with VR content?"

## The VR Stool

The form of the VR stool draws inspriration from keycaps and the semiotics of this shape invites the users to try to interact with the stool. The keycap shape is created by stretching and tying a piece of lycra over the internals of the stool.
