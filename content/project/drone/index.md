This is a passion project that I did with my friend George where we assembled a raspberry pi based drone from the ground-up and connected a xbox controller with a custom python script for flight control.

Neither one of us is from a traditional engineering background, so the learning curve was steep but very rewarding for us. We went through a lot of debugging and re-soldering the Raspberry Pi and other parts. Hard work eventually paid off - we managed to take off and control the drone smoothly after 5 days of hard work. Woohoo!

Not the most pretty drone, but we are proud of it.
